## ~~Task 8.13~~

Change the library application so that it saves the data to a database.

The following things do not have to work just yet

allBooks query with parameters

bookCount field of an author object

author field of a book

editAuthor mutation

## ~~Task 8.14~~

Complete the program so that all queries (except allBooks with the parameter author ) and mutations work.

## ~~Task 8.15~~

Complete the program so that database validation errors (e.g. too short book title or author name) are handled sensibly. This means that they cause UserInputError with a suitable error message to be thrown.

## ~~Task 8.16~~

Add user management to your application.

Make the mutations addBook and editAuthor possible only if the request includes a valid token.
